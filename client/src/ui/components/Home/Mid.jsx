            <p className="inverse short" className="inverse short">
              Traditionally, <span className="bold">milpa</span> is a
              crop-growing system used throughout Mesoamerica. The word milpa is
              derived from the Nahuatl word phrase mil-pa, which translates into
              “maize field”.
            </p>

            <p className="inverse short">
              However, the concept of milpa transcends a system of agriculture.
              It is a{" "}
              <span className="bold">
                sociocultural construct that involves a deep community
                relationship.
              </span>
            </p>
            <p className="inverse short">
              It has been noted that “the making of milpa is the central, most
              sacred act, one which binds together the family, the community,
              the universe…[it] forms the core institution of Indian society in
              Mesoamerica and its religious and social importance often appear
              to exceed its nutritional and economic importance.”{" "}

                This is why milpa perfectly embodies our work. It is rooted in
