      <p style={{ marginBottom: ".7em", fontSize: "20px" }}>
        Traditionally, <span className="bold">milpa</span> is a crop-growing
        system used throughout Mesoamerica. The word milpa is derived from the
        Nahuatl word phrase mil-pa, which translates into “maize field”.
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginBottom: ".7em", fontSize: "20px" }}>
        However, the concept of milpa transcends a system of agriculture. It is
        a sociocultural construct that involves a deep community relationship.
      </p>

      <p style={{ fontSize: "20px" }}>
        It has been noted that “the making of milpa is the central, most sacred
        act, one which binds together the family, the community, the
        universe…[it] forms the core institution of Indian society in
        Mesoamerica and its religious and social importance often appear to
        exceed its nutritional and economic importance.” (Erinn Gilson, Sarah
        Kenehan)
